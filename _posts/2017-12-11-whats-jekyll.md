title: Why Ruby? The simplicity, elegance and productivity
---

## The Rails Path 
Like many others i found myself in Ruby world by setting up a simple alpha-blog using Rails framework. Few minutes and there it is - a web app that combines 
all pieces of modern web development in a very elegant and easy way. However, this was .... almost four years ago. Since than i almost completely forgot about programming at all, given my other job commitmment. 
Anyway, almost a year ago from now, i decided to push towards programming and try to land a job as a developer. I have signed quickly for intense five months bootcamp that was focused on Java environment. And although the bootcamp was great, powerful and 
i found myself enjoying the process of learning programming, i was constantly amazed how Java and Ruby differ. Like Matz - the founder of Ruby - used to say in his famous [interview "The philosophy of Ruby"](https://www.artima.com/intv/ruby.html):
> One way is by looking at what can be done with that language. The other is by looking at how we feel using that languageâ€”how we feel while programming.

And although i found that i can really deliver everything with Java, i wasn't feeling the joy of coming up with simple solution, the quick and fast result. Like in this simple FizzBuzz algorithm, that can be written in many, many ways:


{% highlight js %}
(1..100).each { |n|
  if n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0
      puts "#{n} fizz buzz"
    elsif n % 3 == 0
      puts "#{n} fizz"
    elsif n % 5 == 0
      puts "#{n} buzz" 
  else
     puts n
  end
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Ruby - the joy
I feel good writing Ruby code. Even the complex code - i try to practice reading a code written by others at least several times per week - seem to click together much faster, than when i was reading Java verbose code. Very often the experienced Java developers used to say 
that you have to love the grind of working with Java - and it is very good fit for some people, but im in that part of population that needs to feel a joy while working. And here comes Ruby, here comes Matz with his famous quote about joy:
>You want to enjoy life, don't you? If you get your job done quickly and your job is fun, that's good isn't it? That's the purpose of life, partly. Your life is better.
 >I want to solve problems I meet in the daily life by using computers, so I need to write programs. By using Ruby, I want to concentrate the things I do, not the magical rules of the language, like starting with public void something something something to say, "print hello world." I just want to say, "print this!" I don't want all the surrounding magic keywords. I just want to concentrate on the task. That's the basic idea. So I have tried to make Ruby code concise and succinct.

This quotation resonates so much within me, that <b> about a month after i finished Java bootcamp i have decided to push towards Ruby and push hard</b>. Hence this blog, that is just a simple journal of my road.
